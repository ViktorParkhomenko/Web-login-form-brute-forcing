# Web login form brute forcing

This project revolves around developing and executing a brute force attack on a web-based login form. The project was divided into two main components:

Building a simple web application using Flask with an HTML login page.
Developing a Python script to automate brute force login attempts by using a dictionary of common passwords and monitoring server responses.
The web application acted as the target for brute-forcing attempts, simulating a scenario where weak login credentials are used, and the brute force attack helps identify the correct username-password combination.
